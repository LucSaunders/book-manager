Avoid propdrilling


Solution 1
*   Avoid breaking up your components. 
*   How much data needs to be shared at the child level?
*   If you're using only one grandhild component consider passing down the whole [rendered] component as a prop.

Solution 2
Context API
*   For small apps, to avoid propdrilling.
*   Is a way to broadcast data to components.
*   Uses "provider" components and "consumer" components
*   Is like passing a note: from person to person, or ball up & throw across the room to final recipient.
* Can't use Context to communicate state between components, but can use hooks to do so. 

Solution 3
Redux
